CNN for CIFAR-10 Classification
Objective
The goal of this project is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project will explore CNN architecture, feature extraction, and model evaluation, using deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 images (32x32 pixels, RGB) across 10 classes, making it ideal for training CNN models.

Number of classes: 10

Image size: 32x32 pixels

Total images: 60,000 (50,000 training, 10,000 test)

You can access the CIFAR-10 dataset on Hugging Face.

Instructions
1. Dataset Preparation
Load CIFAR-10 from Hugging Face.

Preprocess the images:

Normalize pixel values to the range [0, 1].

Convert labels into a one-hot encoded format.

Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets.

2. CNN Classifier Implementation
Build a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch.

CNN Architecture should include:

Convolutional Layers: For feature extraction from images.

ReLU Activation: To introduce non-linearity.

Pooling Layers: Max/Average pooling to reduce spatial dimensions.

Fully Connected Layers: For learning complex patterns for classification.

Softmax Output Layer: To generate class probabilities.

Training:

Use an appropriate optimizer (e.g., Adam or SGD).

3. Evaluate and Compare Model Performance
Evaluate the model accuracy on the test data.

Perform data augmentation (e.g., flipping, rotation) and analyze its impact.

Compare the following models:

Model trained without data augmentation.

Model trained with data augmentation.

Visualize the loss and accuracy curves for both models.

4. Feature Map Visualization
Extract and visualize feature maps from different layers.

Observe how early layers capture basic features like edges, while deeper layers capture high-level features.

5. Ablation Study: Impact of Hyperparameters on Accuracy
Experiment with different hyperparameters and analyze their effects on model performance:

Learning Rate: Test at least three different learning rates (e.g., 0.001, 0.01, 0.1).

Batch Size: Test different batch sizes (e.g., 16, 32, 64).

Number of Convolutional Filters: Experiment with varying numbers of filters (e.g., 16, 32, 64).

Number of Layers: Compare the impact of different numbers of convolutional layers (e.g., 3, 5, 7).

6. Evaluation and Comparison of Model Performance
Performance Metrics:
For both models, evaluate:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Comparison of Models:

Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Without Augmentation	[Value]	[Value]	[Value]	[Value]
With Augmentation	[Value]	[Value]	[Value]	[Value]
Confusion Matrix Visualization:
Plot and visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap for both models to analyze misclassifications.

Loss and Accuracy Curves:
Plot training and validation loss over epochs to analyze convergence.

Plot training and validation accuracy over epochs to evaluate overfitting or underfitting.

Compare the curves for both models and discuss the key observations.
